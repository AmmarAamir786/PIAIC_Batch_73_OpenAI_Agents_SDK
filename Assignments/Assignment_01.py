Assignment 01: Integrating a Web Search Tool with Agents

Objective:
- Search for a free version of a web search API (e.g., SerpAPI free tier, or any other public API).
- Use it as a tool in an agent.
- When the user queries the agent, it should use the tool to search the web and provide real-time data in its response.

Instructions:
1. Research and select a free web search API.
2. Write a Python function that calls the API and returns search results. (Can definitely take help from chatgpt but need to understand the code)
3. Use @function_tool to register your function as a tool.
4. Create an agent and pass your tool in the tools argument.
5. Test your agent by asking it to search for current news or information.

Bonus:
- Create another project that uses a different API (not web search) for your own use case (That interests you, but it has to provide some value).

Submission:
- Submit your code and a short report describing the API you chose, why you chose it, and how you integrated it.
